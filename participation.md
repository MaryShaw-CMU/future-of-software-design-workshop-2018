# Participation

This first iteration of the workshop is invitation only.  We plan to post
notes and summaries from the workshop to this repo.

## Lighting Talks

To help warm everyone up for a great discussion we are asking everyone
to prepare a lightning talk to share with the group on Saturday morning.

All lightning talks will be five minutes or less.  The format is 100% to you.
We will have projectors and flip charts available if you would like to use
those during your lightning talk.  Slides are optional but if you choose
to use slides remember to bring your laptop and appropriate display port
adapters.

Please share your slides or a brief write-up of your lighting talk with
everyone before the workshop by submitting a pull request to this repo.

### Ideas for your Lightning Talk

Who are you?  What do you hope to get of this workshop?

What are some problems you see today?  What problems do you
think we might face 5, 10, 15 years down the road?

What questions do you have about the future of software development?
What worries you most?

What might the world look like in 5, 10, 15 years?

## Costs

The SEI is very graciously sponsoring this event and will defray all meeting
room and food costs.  Participants are responsible for covering travel, lodging
(we have negotiated a $129 per night room block rate), and alcohol.
