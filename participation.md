# Participation

This first iteration of the workshop is iteration only.  We plan to post
notes and summaries from the workshop to this repo for anyone interested.

## Lighting Talks

To help prime the pumps and warm everyone up we are asking all participants
to prepare a lightning talk to share with the group on Saturday morning.

All lightning talks will be five minutes or less.  The format is 100% to you.
We will have projectors and flip charts available if you would like to use
those during your lightning talk.  Slides are optional but if you choose
to use slides remember to bring your laptop and appropriate image adapters.

Please share your slides or a brief write-up of your lighting talk with
everyone before the workshop by submitting a pull request to this repo.


## Costs

The SEI is very graciously sponsoring this event and will defray all meeting
room and food costs.  Participants are responsible for covering travel, lodging
(we have negotiated a $129 per night room block rate), and alcohol.
