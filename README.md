# Future of Software Design Workshop 2017

Our hope is to gather a small number of thoughtful people (roughly two dozen) with somewhat diverse backgrounds.  
Our objectives are to:

* Get academics and industry chatting
* Keep the group small with ample social gathering (dinners, etc.) for discussion to continue informally
* Bring big ideas about software design (not just architecture) and related areas
* Provide enough structure to reveal different ideas but allow the conversations to flow

It would be nice to get a modest publication or continued collaboration

## Important Dates
