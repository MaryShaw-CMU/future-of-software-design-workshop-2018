# Designing the Software Systems of the Future

There are a number of new paradigms (probably better said old paradigms that finally start influencing how we design and develop software) that software engineers need to take into account when thinking about structure and behavior of software intensive systems and their designs:

* Data, data, data - its creation, consumption, analysis and influence 
* The pervasiveness of hardware systems that heavily rely on software to function reliably
* The advances in AI and AI components increasingly being a part of software systems
* The race to innovate around autonomous systems
* “There is an app for that” way of developing systems that put integration and reliability challenges to a new level
* Programming paradigms such as functional programming 
* And yet an enormous amount of resources still spent on legacy software that we have already created and the perplexing challenges of moving to this brave new world

The hard questions to ask, however, remain hidden behind the excitement such advances create. Such a shift in how software-intensive systems are created and consumed do also require for us to question whether the old paradigms still hold in designing these systems. There are several hard questions to ask:
* What kind of new architectural styles are needed to be able to ensure the intended behavior of such systems
* As more of the promise of the AI and autonomy becomes reality, what kinds of design and programming paradigms will help us ensure their safety, security, and reliability. 
* Should such systems be tested with different approaches? Can the design of these systems increasing ensure their testability as well?

A few of us as we were mulling over these questions (admittedly over beer) we came to the conclusion that moving this mountain requires some more intelligent minds. Hence came the idea of this workshop.

Our goals are simple:
* Put together the right people together in an engaging enough location to enable them to exchange ideas
* Provide enough structure that leaves room for ideas to flow spontaneously
* And hopefully generate concrete thoughts that can help our community revitalize its ownership of responsible design, importance of structure and behavior systems so that they support future innovations.
