## Getting to Pittsburgh

Airport: [PIT - Pittsburgh International Airport](http://www.flypittsburgh.com/)

Train: [Union Station](https://www.amtrak.com/content/amtrak/en-us/stations/pgh.html)

### Ground Transportation from the Airport 

Depending on when you arrive, the airport is about a 30 minute drive from downtown Pittsburgh.

Take the bus!  Public transportation is available -- look for the 28x.  [Google Maps Schedule](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Pittsburgh+International+Airport+(PIT),+1000+Airport+Blvd,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15231/Kimpton+Hotel+Monaco+Pittsburgh,+Pittsburgh,+PA/@40.456361,-80.2506608,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m18!4m17!1m5!1m1!1s0x88345cc34ecd5b37:0xc812270d148d3f59!2m2!1d-80.2413113!2d40.4957722!1m5!1m1!1s0x8834f159ca51bb95:0x868c158cd02db8a!2m2!1d-79.9963286!2d40.4414181!2m3!6e0!7e2!8j1515792182!3e3).  The 28X will take about an hour to get downtown but it's only $2.50.

Typical ground transportation is available including Uber (maybe you'll get a robot car!), taxi, private limo, and super shuttle.  Prices are typically in the $40 range one way.

Let the other workshop participants know if you'd like to share a ride and maybe you can carpool.  It's good for the environment and your pocket book.
