### 8:30- 10:30 Pitches by participants

[5 minute lightning talks](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/future-of-software-design-workshop-2017/blob/master/participation.md#lighting-talks) by participants, their input/what they bring to the table. At a minimum we should probably ask:
What are the challenges that current technology/advances are not addressing
What kind of a vision will drive software systems of the future that the individual sees
What are the needed innovations that we should be rallying behind

### 10:30-11:00 Break

### 11:00-12:30 Discussion themes, expected outcomes
What we have heard?
what we would like to focus on?
What are common themes?
What we would like to get out of the discussions?

### 12:30-13:30 Lunch

### 13:30-15:00 Small group discussions

We can use several techniques here. If there a actual themes emerging we can just divide up. But I find that rarely useful. I am not sure how everyone would be receptive but can we maybe try out things like brainwriting for part of the time or even in small groups;
