Lunch provided.


### 13:30 - 15:00 Small group discussions


We can use several techniques here. If there a actual themes emerging we can just divide up. But I find that rarely useful. I am not sure how everyone would be receptive but can we maybe try out things like brainwriting for part of the time or even in small groups;
